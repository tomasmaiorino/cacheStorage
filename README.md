# CacheStorage
So far the main class executes the application based on the content in the cacheEntries.txt

Three parameters are required to run the application:
In order to test run the application to do an initial check run this command:

1 - The cacheEntries file path e.g: /Users/name/projects/cacheStorage/cacheEntries.txt

2 - The max items in the cache storage. I must be a number

3 - The ttl for all entries in seconds.

java RunningExampleCachedStorage /Users/user/projects/cacheStorage/cacheEntries.txt 100 1
